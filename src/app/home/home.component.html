Slap kitten brother with paw kitty run to human with blood on mouth from frenzied attack on poor innocent mouse, don't i look cute? to pet a cat, rub its belly, endure blood and agony, quietly weep, keep rubbing belly. Use lap as chair eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants. While happily ignoring when being called lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep and demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it hopped up on catnip.
